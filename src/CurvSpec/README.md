## CurvSpec ##
Routines to compute power spectra of curved-sky (Healpix) maps based on the *MASTER* (Monte Carlo Apodised Spherical Transform EstimatoR) algorithm  ([Hivon et al. 2002](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...567....2H)). It works with spin-0 fields (spinorial version is on its way) and makes use of the SLATEC routine rc3jj.f to compute the 3j-Wigner symbols needed for the mode-coupling matrix computation.
## Installation ##
Download the tar.gz-file (or clone from the repo) and execute

```
python setup.py install
```
